# Login_SignUp_backend

Welcome to Login_SignUp_backend! This is a backend application built using Python Django framework and PostgreSQL for the database. It incorporates a modified free website template, complete with login, logout, signup, and user-specific features.

## Features

1. Dynamic Content: The application allows for dynamic content management, meaning any updates made through the Django admin panel reflect directly on the website.
2. User Authentication: Users can log in using their credentials, and upon login, their username is displayed on the website.
3. Signup/Registration: New users can register on the website through the signup page.
4. Logout Option: Logged-in users have the option to log out securely.
